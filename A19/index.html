        [Verse 1]
        Fatal, this attraction <br>
        Yeah, we might just end up crashin'<br>
        But I'm ready if it happens with you <br>       
        Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family <br>
        And I need someone to hold onto <br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus] <br>
        You're the only thing I know <br>
        And I don't wanna let this go <br>
        Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home <br>
        Can't wait 'til we're alone <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus] <br>
         We were built to last <br>
        We were built like that <br>
        Baby, take my hand <br>
        Dive in this romance <br>
        We could burn and crash <br>
        We could take a chance <br>
        Holdin' nothin' back <br>
        <br>
       <i> Like it's our last dance <br>
        Like it's our last dance <br>
        Like it's our last dance <br>
